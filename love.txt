If you see a single guy at the age of 30 or so.
It doesn't mean he wishes to be single,
He might have fell in love with someone when he was young.
he looked forward to forever,but life played a trick on him.
then he became afraid of love ,because he already lost so much already,
finally, he lost the ability to love and be loved.
his face has been ridded by the remnant of time gone by
and his eyes are full of stories from yesteryears.
